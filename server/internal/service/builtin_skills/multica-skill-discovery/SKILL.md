# Discovering skills before import

Use this skill when the user wants a capability but does not provide a specific
skill URL. Your job is to find candidates from search metadata, select the best
fit, and then hand off to the Multica import path.

discovery is not installation. The final installation step is still:

```bash
multica skill import --url <selected-url> --output json
```

## Start from the user need

Turn the user's request into a short search query. Keep the query close to the
capability, not the user's whole sentence.

Examples:

- "make better landing pages" → `landing page design`
- "help agents find existing skills" → `find skills`
- "generate frontend UI polish guidance" → `frontend design`

## Find candidates

Use Multica's structured skill search CLI first:

```bash
multica skill search <query> --output json
```

The command returns candidate objects with fields such as:

```json
{
  "name": "<skill-name>",
  "url": "https://clawhub.ai/<owner>/<skill>",
  "source": "clawhub.ai",
  "repo": null,
  "install_count": 123,
  "github_stars": null,
  "description": "..."
}
```

Treat the response as candidates, not a product decision. The CLI normalizes the
upstream search source so agents do not need to parse external human-readable
output. If search returns `upstream_unavailable` or no trustworthy candidates,
say that clearly instead of inventing a URL.

Do not stop at the first result. Search output is a candidate list, not a product
decision.

## Select using metadata-only before import

Selection is metadata-only before import. Current search does not expose a remote
content preview. Compare candidates with the user's actual need using only the
fields available in the search result:

- `name`;
- `url`;
- `source`;
- `repo`, only when non-null;
- `install_count`;
- `github_stars`, only when non-null;
- `description`;
- source reputation and owner/repo credibility;
- whether the URL is importable by `multica skill import`;
- whether the candidate appears too project-specific from its metadata.

Do not claim you inspected remote skill content during search. The limitation is
explicit: full content verification happens after import by reading the imported
workspace skill, for example:

```bash
multica skill get <skill-id> --output json
```

If metadata is too weak to choose safely, say that and ask for a URL or a more
specific requirement instead of importing a weak match.

## Import after choosing

After selecting the best candidate, import through Multica:

```bash
multica skill import --url <selected-url> --output json
```

Use `multica-skill-importing` for duplicate handling, returned fields, and agent
binding.

Do not use `npx skills add` as the final step; this is not `npx skills add`. That
installs outside Multica and will not create a managed workspace skill.

## Output to the user

Report the decision, not the whole search dump:

- selected skill name and URL;
- why the metadata matched the user's request;
- any strong rejected alternatives if relevant;
- import result: `id`, `name`, `config.origin`, files count;
- whether it still needs to be bound to an agent.

If no candidate is trustworthy, say that. Do not import a weak match just to do
something.

## Incorrect → correct

Incorrect:

```text
I opened the first remote skill file during search, verified its full content,
and installed it with npx skills add.
```

Correct:

```text
I searched for `frontend design`, compared the top candidates by install count,
source reputation, URL, description, and any non-null repo/github_stars metadata,
selected the matching skills.sh URL, and imported it with `multica skill import --url <selected-url> --output json`.
```

## Source of truth

- `multica skill search <query> --output json` / `GET /api/skills/search?q=...`
  are the supported structured discovery surfaces.
- Search returns candidate metadata only; it is not a remote content preview.
- `multica-skill-importing` defines the final Multica workspace import path.
- `POST /api/skills/import` and `multica skill import --url` are the supported
  Multica installation surfaces.
- Discovery returns candidates; it does not replace the workspace import API.
